"""What every test of the interface needs: somewhere of its own to be running in.

The interface writes down what is typed at it, in the project it is running in. A test types
things, and the project it would be writing them into is this one.

It also opens set up to run: a flow, and the first agent installed to run it on. What is
installed is whatever is on the developer's own PATH, so a test that did not say would pass
here and fail on a machine with nothing installed, or start a real coding agent on a line
typed as a no-op. Every test therefore starts with nothing installed until it says otherwise.
