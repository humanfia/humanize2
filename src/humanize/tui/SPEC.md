Expose `Humanize`.

## `app.py`

```python
class Humanize(App[None]):
    def __init__(self) -> None: ...
```

The terminal interface, which `hmz` with no command opens. It is a coding agent's own
terminal with a flow underneath: laid out as a transcript, a multi-line editor, and a status
line, with what the flow is doing beside the transcript.

- It MUST open on a flow that is only talking to one agent, at the first agent installed, so
  that saying something is all it takes to start. A flow is what is reached for once talking
  to one agent is not the shape of the work, and that is not known before anything has been
  said. The agent it opens on MUST NOT be at the hardest effort the model takes: that is the
  one to reach for, not the one to spend before it has been asked for.
- Choosing a flow MUST stop whatever is running, since a flow is chosen in order to be run.
  Looking at the flows and leaving without choosing MUST change nothing at all.
- It MUST be drawn in the terminal's own colours, and MUST NOT ask the terminal what they
  are: every surface is the terminal's background and everything drawn is one of the sixteen
  colours the terminal already has a setting for, or a reversal of what is already there. A
  colour of its own would be a guess about the background it lands on.
- The editor MUST mean both things at once: a line beginning with `/` is a command, and any
  other line is said to the agent working right now, through `SessionBase.interject`, so that
  a turn already under way takes it into account rather than being restarted with it.
- Enter MUST send and `ctrl+j` MUST break the line, so that a long prompt can be written.
- A half-typed line MUST be offered what it could be finished with, in a list under the
  editor, and tab MUST take what is highlighted. What is offered MUST be reconsidered when the
  cursor moves as well as when the text does: an offer made at the end of a line MUST NOT
  still stand once the cursor is back in the middle of it.
- Keys the offers are using MUST be theirs only while there are offers: a prompt of more than
  one line needs its arrows back, and focus MUST NOT be able to leave the editor.
- A typed line MUST reach the agent that has a turn open, not whichever was named last: an
  agent between turns may still be holding a session that would take it silently.
- `hmz collect` and `hmz anchor` MUST NOT be commands here. Neither is a thing to do to a flow
  that is running, and a command that only ever means one thing is a command line.
- A turn MUST be shown as it happens: which agent is taking it, each tool it uses as one
  compact row, and what it says. It MUST be shown once -- a backend teeing to stderr for the
  benefit of a plain terminal MUST NOT also be shown here. `/details` MUST toggle all of what
  a turn did on the way to its answer, tool calls and thinking together: they are one question
  -- how much of the working to show -- and were two switches for no reason.
- An agent that stops to ask MUST be able to reach whoever is at the prompt: the question and
  what it offers MUST be shown, and the next line typed MUST be the answer rather than a word
  put into the turn. `/afk` MUST toggle whether it may ask at all, and asking MUST start
  allowed, so that an agent that really needs a person gets one unless it has been said that
  none is there. A question still up when the flow ends or is stopped MUST end with it, so
  that stopping a flow is never blocked on one.
- `ctrl+c` MUST take back the nearest thing there is to take back: what is half-typed if
  anything is, and the flow if not. Two of them in a row MUST leave, so that leaving is always
  two presses and never one.
- A line that cannot be carried out MUST be shown and MUST leave the interface up. Only
  `/exit` and two `ctrl+c` close it.

## `monitor.py`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class Spend:
    model: str
    tokens: int
    rate: float


@dataclass
class Monitor:
    def begins(self, agent: str, model: str) -> None: ...
    def ends(self, agent: str) -> None: ...
    def spend(
        self,
        agent: str,
        tokens: int,
        model: str | None = None,
        now: float | None = None,
    ) -> None: ...
    def spending(self, now: float | None = None) -> list[Spend]: ...
    def now_working(self) -> list[str]: ...
    def graph(self) -> list[str]: ...
```

What a flow is doing, kept from the turns going past -- which is the only place it is visible,
a flow being a Python file that may branch any way it likes.

- MUST be written from `AgentBase.watch`, and MUST NOT ask anything of the flow.
- Every read and every write MUST hold the lock: the turns are on threads of their own and
  the interface reads while they run.
- `graph` MUST report every agent the flow has run, marking whichever are working, and every
  handover between them with how often it happened: that directed graph is the shape of the
  run.
- `spending` MUST be per model rather than per agent, since two agents at one model are one
  bill, and MUST report a rate over a recent window only -- a flow that has stopped reads as
  stopped rather than as whatever it once averaged.
- A backend that says what a turn cost MUST be believed over what its agent was configured
  with: a turn that reached for a sub-agent spent it on that model.

## `complete.py`

```python
def offered(typed: str, commands: tuple[str, ...]) -> list[str]: ...
def flows(where: str | None = None) -> list[str]: ...
```

What the editor offers to finish, which is the only way anything is chosen.

- Nothing MUST be chosen from a dialog. A `/` MUST offer the commands, and a flag MUST offer
  whatever it is for -- the flows below this directory, the backends an agent runs on -- so
  that there is one way to say a thing and it is the way it is written down.
- An offer MUST be the whole of what the word becomes, so that taking one replaces what was
  typed rather than being appended to it.
- Finding the flows MUST NOT cost the interface its responsiveness: it reads every Python
  file below this directory, which is far too slow to repeat between keystrokes.
