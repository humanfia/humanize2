# Mock CLI performance evaluation — 2026-09-10

All twelve built-in CLI backends use immediate loopback model responses and dummy credentials, including Cursor's separately distributed official local runtime. The CLI still reads files, edits code, executes the unchanged checker and resumes its native conversation. No live-model samples enter these performance comparisons. The [September 9 real-provider report](RESULTS.md) remains a separate historical record.

## Confirmed concurrency

Each row passed five candidate repetitions against five fresh original serial controls. The ratio columns show the largest of cold/warm p50/p95 for that metric. All primary startup and fixed-work gates pass; the separate legacy verdict uses different event boundaries.

Grok Build's row is measured against the complete-task floor alone: cold and warm p50 and
nearest-rank p95 of turn start to the hmz result, each at most 2× five fresh original serial
controls. The startup and fixed-work columns are the earlier gates and are not evaluated for
it. Its worst complete-task ratio at twenty sessions is 1.701. Twenty is published rather
than the twenty-two that also passed five repetitions, because a separate five-repeat trial
of twenty-two missed on cold p95 at 2.050 and twenty passed every trial it was given. Its
ratios, controls and serial-control drift are in
[its evidence](evidence-2026-09-10/grok-held-open-transport-summary.json).

Exact ratios, original/candidate phase distributions, all repeat denominators and the selected source references are in [the machine-readable result](results-2026-09-10.json). The retained trial sequence follows; `P` is a primary pass, `T` a timing miss, and `E` an execution failure. An entry `6×5 P` means six concurrent sessions and five repetitions. Three-repeat passes remain exploratory.

The initial [twelve-backend protocol smokes](evidence-2026-09-10/smokes/index.json) and [optional OpenCode two-session exploration](evidence-2026-09-10/optional-opencode-db-n2/index.json) precede this matrix and are retained separately. No failed or interrupted sample was turned into a passing result.

## Method

Each backend is measured alone inside a cgroup limited to four CPUs, 16 GiB memory and zero swap, with affinity to physical cores 8–11. The mock server runs on separate CPUs outside that scope; tests and audits use other CPUs. The [retained fixture launch observation](evidence-2026-09-10/diagnostics/fixture-launch-provenance.json) records the planned affinity override and observed separation. This is a shared 64-logical-CPU host with enforced limits, not a dedicated virtual machine. OS page caches remain warm between fresh sessions.

Every pair contains cold and warm turns. Each turn must perform the same three real shell tool calls and four successful workload requests, produce a fresh execution proof and preserve immutable task inputs. The warm answer must recall a conversation-only marker. Missing work, repeated workload requests, provider errors, provenance changes or surviving processes invalidate the case. Auxiliary calls and cancellations remain separately visible. Error coverage is fixture-only: every fixture workload and auxiliary HTTP failure is checked, while native auxiliary log coverage is incomplete. This does not establish that every CLI emitted no native error.

Startup runs from turn submission to the earliest correlated provider request, including auxiliary requests. Fixed-work time runs from that request to the hmz result; it includes native tool execution, adapter delivery and mock transport. Cold/warm p50 and nearest-rank p95 must each satisfy startup ≤2× and fixed work ≤1.10× against fresh original serial controls. The original first-event/post-first-tool harness verdict is retained separately; first-event time is not a startup measurement. Synthetic token counts do not establish model throughput.

Three-repeat ladder trials are exploratory. A chosen passing boundary requires five fresh original serial controls and five candidate groups. The observed passing boundary and failed neighboring trials do not prove a universal maximum: host scheduling and the unequal sample counts of serial and concurrent p95 estimates remain relevant. These trials do not measure mixed-backend concurrency.

## Configuration conditions

Original source is commit `3e0e6edf1d47ae27a70c1a334ee6cf364d05f59b`. Candidate snapshots, native executable hashes, fixture/harness revisions, per-turn distributions and proof checks are retained with the evidence. All configured model routes use literal `127.0.0.1` and complete child environments with dummy keys; no real-provider fallback is configured. Fixed JSON/SSE responses have no intentional delay. Fixture processing time and active handlers are retained to distinguish server contention from CLI overhead.

Cursor uses the unchanged official local distribution `2026.09.08-6caf4ff` with native authless mode and an OpenAI-compatible local endpoint. The original adapter's `fixture-model[fast=false]` and the candidate's `fixture-model` receive the same response policy. This validates the local distribution's coding tools and conversation resume; standard Cursor authentication and service RPC are outside this profile. Native update/command-discovery errors are separate from the configured model route and are retained where observable.

OpenCode's default shared SQLite database failed during the first two-session candidate repetition, before any model request. The controller stopped that case and retained its missing and undispatched work. A separate, optional native `OPENCODE_DB` launcher selects one persistent database per canonical task workspace for both original and candidate. Its interpreter startup and database initialization are included in timing. This condition changes benchmark configuration, not the production driver; it does not replace the failed default trial. The initial three-repeat isolated comparison passed all gates and verified nine distinct databases with cold/warm native conversation continuity; the later five-repeat confirmation also passed.

Codex and ZCode use separate Agent instances. Other backends use multiple Sessions on one Agent. Antigravity receives the same explicit workspace argument in original and candidate; its first native formatting-only settings rewrite is retained as a stopped provenance trial and subsequent locks pin the rewritten bytes.

## Implementation and validation

Qwen and Antigravity reuse official streaming CLI processes for ordinary turns, resume finite structured-output turns and restart when native settings or skills change. Antigravity also keeps finite slash commands. Usage handling and native structured-result/workspace behavior retain dedicated regression coverage. The Linux supervisors remove temporary ctypes pointer cycles without changing the flow API.

Grok Build is driven through the Agent Client Protocol it already serves its own IDE clients
on: `grok agent stdio` is one process for the conversation, `session/new` opens it and each
ordinary turn is a `session/prompt` written to a process that is already up. The rungs that
take tools away, an agent told not to search the web, and a turn held to a shape have no flag
on that process and still run `grok -p --resume`; the session id is Grok Build's own either
way and each transport loads what the other opened. Against the same five serial controls,
measured back to back in one group, the original passed fourteen sessions at 1.856 and failed
sixteen at 2.077 while the candidate passed twenty at 1.701 and failed twenty-four at 2.128.
Warm turns carry the change: a warm complete task is 0.551× the original serial control at
twenty sessions and 0.418× at sixteen, where the original's own warm turn is already 2.077×
at sixteen. Neither ladder is monotone at these sample counts — the original passes fourteen
and misses twelve at 2.007 in the same session — so a rung either side of a boundary is
within the movement of the p95 estimate rather than outside it.

Kimi wakes authoritative REST reads from official WebSocket notifications, answers native heartbeats and retains polling recovery. Mock profiling exposed a full receive queue delaying socket disposal by one second after a completed turn. The bounded receive queue stays unchanged; a 100 ms close grace removes approximately 900 ms from that wait. Separate instrumented before/after task probes verified cleanup and exact task proofs; those timings are diagnostic only and excluded from performance gates.

See [fixture reproduction](DETERMINISTIC.md), [the general runner](RUNNING.md) and [rejected process-reuse experiments](REJECTED.md). `uv run pytest` passed 2,239 tests with 77 skips and 41 warnings in 716.87 seconds, including the 58 benchmark tests. `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` also passed. Skips cover opt-in live-agent checks and unavailable Docker/localhost SSH; no live-agent tests were enabled for mock profiling. Native feature and flow contract checks from the earlier evaluation remain separately documented in [the historical report](RESULTS.md). The production flow implementation/API is unchanged.

## Remaining measured costs

The [CPU phase comparison](evidence-2026-09-10/diagnostics/cli-cpu-phases.json) and its [input provenance](evidence-2026-09-10/diagnostics/cli-cpu-phases-provenance.json) cover selected four/eight-session trials. At eight sessions, Qwen, Grok and Pi approach the four-core quota during portions of fixed work. Peak memory in these cases stays well below 16 GiB, with no recorded OOM events. Fixture processing remains a few milliseconds per turn. Shared process-tree samples overlap concurrent turns; they cannot attribute CPU to an individual session or prove which native function is expensive.

Grok Build's remaining cost at its own boundary is the one process start a session still pays. A cold complete task at twenty sessions is 1.610× the original serial control where the warm one is 0.495×, and the phase split of a cold turn is the process boot the protocol's `initialize` waits on: 0.245 s of a 0.384 s cold turn serially and 0.292 s at twenty sessions, against 27 ms for `grok --version`, so what it costs is the agent coming up rather than the 150 MiB executable loading. Opening every session on one process removes all but the first of those boots and measured about a third faster on both turns at twenty and twenty-four sessions. It is retained as measured headroom that was not taken, in [rejected experiments](REJECTED.md).

Lowering Grok's native worker count reduced threads but did not improve absolute task timing. MiMo's per-workspace database profile also missed the fixed-work gate. Both are retained as [rejected experiments](REJECTED.md), alongside OpenCode/MiMo server-reuse prototypes and the Cursor local persistence investigation. [MiMo's native phase diagnostic](evidence-2026-09-10/diagnostics/mimo-default-n2-native-phases.json) locates most of its two-session increase between tool requests; it does not establish SQLite contention as the cause. [Kimi's cleanup diagnostic](evidence-2026-09-10/diagnostics/kimi-notification-cleanup.json) isolates the adopted close-grace improvement.

These results establish observed concurrency for this fixed workload and the installed versions. They do not prove that no future native-runtime or adapter optimization is possible. Official CLI binaries remain unchanged; unsupported protocol substitutions and changes that regressed measured startup were not adopted.
